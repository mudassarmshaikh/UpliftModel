# Campaign Conversion Target with Uplift Modeling

### Uplift modeling, also known as incrementality modeling or persuasion modeling, models the causal effect of a treatment on the outcome for different individuals. Uplift modeling has been widely applied in marketing, personalized medicine, and political elections, scenarios in which you donâ€™t simply want to predict an outcome, but predict how that outcome might change with respect to a treatment.

*Uplift modeling is an important yet novel area of research in machine learning which aims to explain and to estimate the causal impact of a treatment at the individual level.*
